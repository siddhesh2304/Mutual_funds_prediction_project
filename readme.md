# Mutual Fund Performance Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the performance of mutual fund schemes in India using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains comprehensive information about various mutual fund schemes, including attributes such as expense ratio, fund size, returns over different time periods, risk levels, fund managers, and more. The goal is to build predictive models to forecast the returns of these mutual fund schemes over specific time durations (1 year, 3 years, and 5 years).

## Project Objectives

### 1. Data Understanding and Preparation
- Explore and clean the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
- Perform feature engineering to derive additional insights and enhance the dataset.

### 2. Model Building and Evaluation
- Select appropriate regression models to predict returns based on the selected features.
- Train and evaluate the models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

### 3. Integration with Power BI for Visualization
- Import the predictions and actual returns data into Power BI.
- Design visualizations to compare predicted returns with the actual returns of mutual fund schemes.
- Create visual representations to compare scheme performance against the average performance of all portfolios.

### 4. Analysis and Insights
- Interpret the model predictions and compare them with the average portfolio performance.
- Provide insights on the performance of individual mutual fund schemes in relation to the average.

### 5. Documentation and Future Improvements
- Document the process, methodologies, and findings for future reference.
- Explore ways to enhance model accuracy and Power BI visualizations for more comprehensive insights.
